Uses multivariate linear regression. Feature scaling has been implemented. I have used numpy as much as possible. Used broadcasting (in matrices) and dot product functions from numpy. Used matplotlib.pyplot to plot graphs. I have copied more than half of the entries from 'housing.data' to 'training.data' and the remaining to 'test.data'. Auto.py uses the two files as training sets and testing sets respectively. user_inputs.py uses the entire 'housing.data' as training set, and then prompts the user to enter features. Learning rates of 1,0.1,0.01 and 0.001 have been used. Their outputs and graphs have been plotted. All graphs shown here have error along Y-axis and no.of iterations along X-axis.
